LSP : Liskov Substitution Principle
=> SubType must be substitutable for their base type

Inheritance property is going to used here

SuperClass : SubClass 1  and SubClass 2 { Derivatives }

Abstract Class :

Take an example of Employee , class make it as abstract class , but their is a function
calculateSalary , as in real work in a company we have different level of employee
salary is going to calculated for each one differently

Type of Employee in a company { Full time employee , Intern Employee , Contract Employee }


Notes : Never use inheritance for just sake of code re-use , use it when their is is-a relationship
