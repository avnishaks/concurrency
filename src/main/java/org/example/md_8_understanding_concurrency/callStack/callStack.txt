About call stack in thread :-


Call stack is private to thread , they are not shared due to this suppose a situation where we have two seperate thread

1. Thread 1 : Call Stack 1
2. Thread 2 : Call Stack 2

NOTES :-
Here we have two different call stack for two different Thread , so when we any functions in the call stack 2 return
the particular return value then it will not able to catch by Thread 1 , as Thread 1 has no linkage to call stack 2
it only linked with call stack 1.
